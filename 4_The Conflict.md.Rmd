The Conflict

At this point in their travels, the ponies have encountered a conflict! 
They’ve traveled too far back in time and they’ve come face to face with…..themselves?
But Wait! 
Where are their hooves? 
Where are their other 2 pony legs? 
And why on earth are they standing so oddly??? 
They…have the same aurora as the ponies but they….are….not? 
Something is off! 
Goodness! 
Are these humans??
We’ve reached the dark ages cried the ponies! 
However will we fight these barbarians? 
How will this conflict possibly be resolved? 
Say tuned to find out!
