The ponies were bored and went to the Princess Celestia's castle to complain.
She was annoyed at them for taking up her time but thought of a clever idea to make use of their presence.
She told them to go to the dungeon and look at the magic archives to see if they could clean it up.
The ponies found a mysterous book and when they bumped it with their noses a portal opened up into another world.
"Let's go in," said Rainbow Dash, ever the impulsive pony. So they were forced to go.
They had a really fun time exploring a world full of dinosaurs and imaginary numbers and when they came back they were all so excited they couldn't sleep.
